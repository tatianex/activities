        <h1>The cottage Garden</h1>
        <p>
            The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense
            plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants
        </p>
        <p>
            The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries,
            although they were invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to
            the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>English state gardens</u>
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis
            on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
